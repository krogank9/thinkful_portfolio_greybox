				<h2>Hi, I'm Logan. Nice to meet you.</h2>
				<div>
					<p class="long-paragraph">
						I am a web and application developer currently enrolled in Thinkful's Full Stack Flex web development program.
						My favorite programming languages and platforms are Javascript, Java, C/C++, Android, and HTML5.
						I have made several Android apps that many people have found useful with more than 10,000 total downloads.
						One of the most enjoyable things about programming to me is how each new project is like a puzzle.
						You have to figure out how the broader project architecture will fit together,
						as well as find and fix bugs which can be like solving an interesting mystery itself.
					</p>
				</div>

					<p class="long-paragraph">
						When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending my time relaxing in nature or bettering myself.
						Destressing by walking in lush green forests and national parks is one of my favorite things to do.
						I'm very health conscious and you can often catch me working out or snacking on some kale.
						Although I try to give myself time away from the screen when I'm not working,
						I often find myself drawn back to invest time in personal projects as well as learning new things.
						In addition to programming, I'm interested in a bunch of different topics such as history, science, and psychology.

				This app turns your phone into a super compact yet full-featured wireless keyboard for your phone.
				It has many useful features such as screen mirroring, CPU/process monitoring, wireless file transfer, and an application launcher.
				This app had 2 components; the Android client and the cross-platform desktop server.
				Simply download the 2 applications, connect to the same WiFi network (or connect via Bluetooth if on Mac/Linux),
				choose a remote and enjoy the convenience of full control over your computer from your pocket.
				Perfect for watching Netflix or for controlling Home Media Centers.
				<br>
				<br>
				To create WifiMouse I used Java for the Android app, and I used C/C++ with Qt for the server.
				Includes an encryption technique that uses AES-256 to secure data of packets sent over the network.
				<br>
				<br>
				Note: Currently unmaintained, this app doesn't produce enough revenue to allow me to regularly update it.

				This app was the first project completed in Thinkful's full-stack web development course.
				It is designed to showcase my knowledge in semantic HTML, CSS, jQuery, event delegation, Javascript, and proper programming practices.
				The topic of the quiz is zombie survival tactics! Take the quiz to find out if you are prepared for the zombie apocalypse!
